- My poster session is Sunday Apr. 22nd, at 11:35am

# Instructions

You should prepare one slide in landscape format (preferably in 16:9 format).
Animations are not allowed. There will be no zooming facilities so make sure the
poster is readable from a distance of 10 meters.

You will have a maximum of 3 minutes for the presentation (strictly enforced),
followed by 2 minutes for discussion.

In addition to your e-Poster you must bring a printout of your poster in A3
format (42 cm x 29.7 cm). You are also encouraged to bring handouts.

Your e-Poster must be handed over to the EDEG staff in the Poster Hall between
8:00-9:00 in the morning of the day of your presentation (between 13:00-14:00 on
Saturday).

Please hang your A3 printout of your e-Poster in the Poster Hall on the first
day of the meeting.
